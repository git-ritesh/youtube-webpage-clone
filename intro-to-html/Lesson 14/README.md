# Lesson-14 | CSS Position

In this lesson we're gonna learn CSS Position.

### Notes : 
- So Position helps us do things like :
  - keep the header at the top of the page 
  - And also helps us keep the sidebar at the top of the page.

- Whenever we see an element on top of another element  that's using CSS Position.

- Like, if you see in the Project, the video time on the top of the thumbnail, the notification counter on top of the icon & when you hover over icon there's a tooltip on top of the page everything is using CSS Position.

- CSS Positions add another dimensions to our page. 

So, Just Like the previous lesson we're gonna create a [position.html](https://) just to practice position.

`position: static;` : it is the default position of an element.
