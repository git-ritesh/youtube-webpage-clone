# Lesson 10 : Nested Layouts Technique

**Note** : _This is the most important lesson of this course. We're gonna learn a technique called the Nested Layout Technique. This will get us to the professional level of HTML and CSS._

**So, what is the Nested Layout Technique?**

The basic idea is that there are two types of layouts : 
1. Vertical Layout : The elements are stacked on top of each other.
2. Horizontal Layout : The elements are placed side by side.

By using the combination of these two layouts, we can create any layout we see on the web.
